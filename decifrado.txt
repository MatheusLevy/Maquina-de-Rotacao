HOW DO WE KNOW IF WEÂ€™RE IN CONTROL? THAT WEÂ€™RE NOT JUST MAKING THE BEST OF WHAT COMES AT US, AND THATÂ€™S IT. TRYING TO CONSTANTLY PICK BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS. LIKE YOUR TWO PAINTINGS IN THE WAITING ROOM. OR COKE AND PEPSI. MCDONALDÂ€™S OR BURGER KING? HYUNDAI OR HONDA? ITÂ€™S ALL PART OF THE SAME BLUR, RIGHT? JUST OUT OF FOCUS ENOUGH. ITÂ€™S THE ILLUSION OF CHOICE. HALF OF US CANÂ€™T EVEN PICK OUR OWN OUR CABLE, GAS, ELECTRIC. THE WATER WE DRINK, OUR HEALTH INSURANCE. EVEN IF WE DID, WOULD IT MATTER? YOU KNOW, IF OUR ONLY OPTION IS BLUE CROSS OR BLUE SHIELD, WHAT THE F*** IS THE DIFFERENCE? IN FACT, ARENÂ€™T THEY THE SAME? NO, MAN, OUR CHOICES ARE PREPAID FOR US, LONG TIME AGO.
